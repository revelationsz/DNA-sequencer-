# DNA-sequencer-
This program will read two sequences from the user, a base and a target, with fixed lengths (20 and 5 respectively). It will then compare these sequences looking for “overlap” and if it finds the overlap, it will print out that a match has been found and a resulting sequence. Otherwise it will indicate that no match was found.
